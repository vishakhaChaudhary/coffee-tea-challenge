## How to get started 
  To get started with the challenge, first read the rest of this readme. Then you can go on and 
  read the README.md inside the frontend and backend folders.
  
  [Backend README](https://github.com/vishakhaChaudhary/coffee-tea-challenge/blob/main/backend/README.md)
  
  [Frontend README](https://github.com/vishakhaChaudhary/coffee-tea-challenge/blob/main/frontend/README.md)

## Introduction Task 

After running the frontend. You will see a list of coffees at "localhost:4000/coffees".

### Task 1 - Coffee list :coffee:
1. This list is currently static on the frontend. The first task is to connect the backend and the frontend to properly render the list with the data coming from the backend.

2. Update both the frontend and the backend to reflect the design in the following file Figma.

### Task 2 - Tea list :tea:

1. After part 1 is finished, we need to implement the second list. A list of teas. We need to add the backend and frontend to reflect the similar data in the design.

### Expected result

1. The challenge is completed if both lists are rendering on the frontend and fetching on the backend.
2. Using nest.js is a mandatory thing from this project.
3. Next.js to help you have a quick start and focus on the coding.
